    <p>1. This is the regular content. All is well. You are online or the cache of the website is still in your browser. This is how most websites work.</p>
    <br>
    <p>2. Disconnect your internet connection. Give this website a 'normal' or 'soft' refresh. It will likely remain the same due to being cached.</p>
    <br>
    <p>3. Give the website a hard refresh i.e:
    <ul>
    <li>* Windows: ctrl + F5</li>
    <li>* Mac/Apple: Apple + R or command + R</li>
    <li>* Linux: F5</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>4. You may see a message saying it cannot load the page because of no internet connection upon doing this the first time as you clear the cache. You may even see the 'Fail T-Rex' just the one time as the Cache doesn't come and help you out. Do not be afraid! visit this URL again and you should see offline page with a comforting orange background. Magic!</p>
